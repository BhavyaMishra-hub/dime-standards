These are boiler plate templates for written consent that can be used while interviewing a respondent.
Many surveys require additional/different components in the consent based on the type of respondent (for example, minors as respondent)
or if the survey includes certain components (such as audio-taping).

This folder includes two consent templates:

1. Written consent – This is a printable version of the contains all details including contact person in case of any issues that
can be shared with the respondent for future use.
2. Oral consent – This is the bare minimum from the written consent that should be read out to a respondent before starting a survey.

Most IRBs require that the entire written consent is shared with the participants and their signature is taken on another copy
retained by the research team. 
In cases that the written consent is too long to read out,
we recommend reading out the oral consent to respondents and giving them a printed copy of the written consent.
Note that the exact practice can vary based on the what has been agreed upon in the IRB approvals.
It is essential to follow the guidelines set in the IRB.

Informed consent must include, at a minimum, information about the authority for conducting the project,
intended uses of the information, and whether participation is mandatory or voluntary.
Projects with applicable risk points must employ two or more of the items listed below.
The higher the risk, the more extensive the informed consent procedures must be, such as the following: 

- Verbal consent that is recorded 
- Notification by an impartial third party 
- Both written and oral communications, with appropriate translations 
- Reminders throughout the interaction or intervention 
- Written materials that can be kept 
- Signed consent form 
- Consent specific to the recording medium (e.g., videotape)

IPA provides a comprehensive [checklist](https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/Consent_Form_Checklist_and_Template.docx)
of all the items that can be included in a consent form.
The University California, Berkeley provides an informed consent
[checklist](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/checklists_worksheets/consent.pdf) as well.
