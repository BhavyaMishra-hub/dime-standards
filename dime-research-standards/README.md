# DIME Research Standards

## Pillar 1 - Research Ethics
- DIME Researchers must secure ethics approval from an institutional review board (IRB) and the appropriate authority in the study location, for studies directly involving human subjects or using personally-identifying information.
- All DIME team members that handle personally-identifiable information must have up-to-date Human Subjects Research Certification.
- DIME staff must ensure confidentiality, privacy, and anonymity of study participants;
study participants must have the opportunity to provide [informed consent](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/tree/master/dime-research-standards/pillar-1-research-ethics/research-ethics-resources/informed-consent-templates), and revoke that consent at any time.

For details and implementation resources, see the [Research Ethics Guidelines](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/dime-standards/blob/master/DIME-Research-Standards/pillar-1-research-ethics)

## Pillar 2 - Research Transparency
- All DIME projects must be registered prior to receiving implementation funding.

For implementation resources, see the [Research Transparency Guidelines](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/dime-standards/blob/master/DIME-Research-Standards/pillar-2-research-transparency)

##  Pillar 3 - Research Reproducibility
- All DIME projects will use GitHub to document data work.
- DIME Research assistants will regularly participate in peer code review sessions.
- All DIME projects will have a [master script](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Master_Do-files) that runs all the other
scripts that are needed for the project, in order.
- *Computational Reproducibility* must be verified by DIME Analytics prior to publication for all DIME Working Papers
and academic publications.

For implementation resources, see the [Research Reproducibility Guidelines](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/dime-standards/blob/master/DIME-Research-Standards/pillar-3-research-reproducibility)

##  Pillar 4 - Data Security
- All personally-identifiable data must be stored and transferred securely, including in communication with field staff.Â 
  - All servers for data collection must be [encrypted](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Encryption) both
  in transit and at rest.
  - All identified data must be stored only in securely encrypted locations,
  and must always be encrypted when shared, even if shared only within the project team
  - All DIME projects must follow the [DIME Data Back-up Protocols](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/blob/master/dime-research-standards/pillar-4-data-security/data-security-resources/onedrive-backup-guidelines.md)

For implementation resources, see the [Data Security Guidelines](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/tree/master/dime-research-standards/pillar-4-data-security)

##  Pillar 5 - Data Publication
- Data must be de-identified prior to publication, DIME Analytics can assist with assessing the risk of statistical disclosure.
- All DIME publications must include a replication package, including a citation or reference to the data in the [World Bank Microdata Catalog](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Microdata_Catalog) and a GitHub repository containing the code required for replication of the paper.
- Data must be deposited into the World Bank's [Development Data Hub](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/) no later than six months after it is acquired, with the
provision to also later deposit any revisions or updates, as per the World Bank Procedure on Development Dataset Acquisition,
Archiving and Dissemination
