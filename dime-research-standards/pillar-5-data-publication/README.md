# DIME Data Publication Standards 
All research data and code from DIME projects are required to be de-identified and published. 

## De-identification
Data must be [de-identified](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/De-identification) by removing all [personally identifiable information](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Personally_Identifiable_Information_(PII)) at the earliest stage possible. 

An initial round of de-identification, dropping any PII not being used in the analysis, must be completed as soon as the data is available. 

Teams can identify potential identifying variables using J-PAL's PII Scan for [R](https://github.com/J-PAL/PII-Scan) and [Stata](https://github.com/J-PAL/stata_PII_scan). 

Thorough de-identification must be completed before data publication, and the risk of statistical disclosure must be assessed using [sdcMicro](http://surveys.worldbank.org/sdcmicro).

## Data and Code Publication
All teams are required to have a publication plan in place for both data and code.

Code should be published using the World Bank GitHub repository. This repository can be private while the project is ongoing but should be made public before the final academic paper is published. We recommend making the GitHub repository public before a working paper is published.

Data should be published to the [World Bank Microdata Catalog](https://microdata.worldbank.org), following the steps outlined on the Microdata Catalog Checklist.

Data must be cataloged within one year of data collection. To avoid risk to publication, access to the dataset may be restricted or treatment variables may be embargoed, see [Guidelines to Releasing Data Before Publication](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Microdata_Catalog#Releasing_data_before_publication)

DIME Analytics can provide support in preparing datasets for publication. Email DIME Analytics to request this support. 

Please contact DIME Analytics if you have any questions or would like additional support in implementing these practices.
