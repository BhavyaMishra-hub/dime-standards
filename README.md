# DIME Standards

This repository will include DIME's research and coding standards. We will use GitHub to develop and version control our standards. Versions of these resources have already been created but not yet converted to markdown files suitable for GitHub. 

We are still happy to share this material upon request, so please feel free to contact us at dimeanalytcis@worldbank.org
