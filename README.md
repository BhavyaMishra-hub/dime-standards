# DIME Standards

This repository includes [DIME](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime)'s commitments to high-quality research. In the spirit of transparency, we are developing and version-controlling DIME's standards on GitHub. This repository is maintained by the [DIME Analytics team](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics). There are two components to the repository: research standards, and coding standards.


## Research Standards ##

DIME Research standards are organized in 5 pillars:

* Pillar 1 - Ethics
* Pillar 2 - Transparency
* Pillar 3 - Reproducibility
* Pillar 4 - Data Security
* Pillar 5 - Data Publication

Requirements for each pillar are detailed in the [Research Standards README](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/tree/master/dime-research-standards)

## Coding Standards ##

DIME Coding standards include two components:

* Style Guides
* Code Review Process

Details, along with associated resources and checklists, are available in the [Coding Standards README](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/tree/master/dime-coding-standards)
