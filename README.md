# DIME Standards

This repository includes [DIME](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime)'s standards for high-quality research. In line with our standard for transparency, we are developing and version-controlling the standards on GitHub. This repository is maintained by the [DIME Analytics team] (https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics). 


## Research Standards ##

DIME Research standards are organized in 5 pillars: 

1. Ethics
2. Transparency
3. Reproducibility
4. Data Security
5. Data Publication

Requirements for each pillar are detailed in the [Research Standards ReadMe] (https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/tree/master/dime-research-standards)
