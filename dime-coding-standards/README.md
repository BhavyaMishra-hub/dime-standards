# DIME Coding Standards

## Style guides

DIME code should adopt the following guides:

- Python: [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- R: [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
- Stata: DIME Analytics style guide (see the Appendix in the [DIME Data Handhook](https://worldbank.github.io/dime-data-handbook/))

## Code review

Department-wide peer code review rounds are held every quarter and all DIME and DIME-affiliated projects can sign up [here](https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_sign_up?caseid=).
