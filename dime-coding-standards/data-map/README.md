# DIME Data Map example

This is an example of a Data Map.
This data mock data but based on a typical impact evaluation project at DIME,
but this framework should work on any research project
that use data from more than one source.

For a more general discussion on DIME's data map framework,
see the data map article on our wiki page: https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Data_Map

You can also read about how a data map fits in the data workflow
in a typical research project in Chapter 3 in DIME data handbook
[Development Research in Practice](https://worldbank.github.io/dime-data-handbook/).
